The Western Collaborative Study Group (WCGS) is one of the earliest studies regarding heart disease. Data were collected from 3,154 males aged $39$ to $59$ in the San-Francisco area in $1960$. They all did not have coronary heart disease at the beginning of the study. The data set comes from the `faraway` package and is called `wcgs`. We will focus on predicting the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease based on the following predictors:

* `age`: age in years
* `sdp`: systolic blood pressure in $mm \ Hg$
* `dbp`: diastolic blood pressure in $mm \ Hg$
* `cigs`: number of cigarettes smoked per day
* `dibep`: behavior type, labeled $A$ and $B$ for aggressive and passive, respectively
