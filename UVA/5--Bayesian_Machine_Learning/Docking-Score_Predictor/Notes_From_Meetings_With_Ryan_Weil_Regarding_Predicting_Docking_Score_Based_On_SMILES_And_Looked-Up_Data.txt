How would I deepen the descriptions of the following Python files and folder?

One of the Python files of ECP-Candle Benchmarks that implement deep learning architectures relevant to problems in cancer: https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Benchmarks/blob/develop/Pilot1/ST1/srt_baseline_keras2.py

One of the Python files of ECP-Candle Benchmarks that implement deep learning architectures relevant to problems in cancer: https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Benchmarks/blob/develop/examples/ADRP/reg_go2.py

A directory of the ATOM Modeling PipeLine (AMPL) for Drug Discovery for building and sharing models of drugs: https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL/tree/master/atomsci/ddm/test/integrative/multitask_split

SP_7JXQ_A_no-H2O_1cons_Mol-FnC_cleaned_arm_hb_16rota_b.csv.gz is full data.

What are residues?
What are descriptors?
What do you think of using an inputted SMILES to lookup a data row, which will be fed into predicting software that predicts docking score?
Can we join tables with docking scores onto raw data?
Why do different data sets have different numbers of columns?
What is the "interest" of each data set?

Can we put together a full data dictionary for the raw data?

Glide Methodology.pdf explains what "glide" is.

Meeting From Friday, 09/29/2023 at 1 PM Eastern Time

Develop a Bayesian model (network?) (Directed Graphical Model?) that predicts continuous docking score given SMILES (and other data built into Bayesian model?)
Could the Bayesian model be
- Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network?
- Natural-Language Neural Network?
- Generative Adversarial Neural Network?
- Graphical Neural Network?
- Cognitive Neural Network?
Do I want to spend a lot of time coming up with priors for R groups?
What information extracted from SMILES directly?
How do I decompose a SMILE into a sub-SMILE or a sub-structure?
How do I encode substructures?
DeepChemâ€™s graph convolution networks outperform all other feature types for neural network
models.
