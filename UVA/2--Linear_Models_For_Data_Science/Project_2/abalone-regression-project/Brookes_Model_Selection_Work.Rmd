## Model Selection Of Abalones


### Import the necessary packages 
```{r,echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(leaps)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(MASS)
```

# Import the data and look at the first six rows

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results="show", message=FALSE, fig.width = 5.3, fig.height = 3.8, fig.align='center'}
Data <- read.csv('Data_Set--Abalones--With_Column_Names.csv', header = TRUE)
head(Data)
```

# Let us first look at the Histogram of the rings Dataset, it seems to be slightly 
right skewed

```{r}
hist(Data$rings)
```


### First, perform all possible regressions

The age and number of rings of a blacklip abalone has a moderate correlation 
with all variables other than sex and shucked weight of the abalone,
for which correlation is low.

***The following order was suggested in our proposal: shell weight, shucked***
***weight, diameter, whole weight, sex, viscera weight, and height. ***
As we can observer the if we consider one predictor model, 
what is the best one predictor?
This turns out to be the shell_weight as stated in our proposal.
If I consider two predictive model what turned out to be the best two predictive 
model are shell weight and shucked weight respectively; and the process goes on 
as per the suggested order.
```{r}
allregressions <- regsubsets(rings~., force.out=NULL, data=Data, nbest=1) 
summary(allregressions)
```
From this we would like to extract the best model based on the following criteria:-  
**criteria 1**:- Having High/Maximum Adjusted R Squared value  
**criteria 2**:- Having Low Mallow's CP  
**criteria 3**:- Having Low BIC 
The Mallow's Cp and BIC are usually similar. 
 
### These can now be extracted from the summary
```{r}
names(summary(allregressions))
```
### adjusted R 2 ?
```{r}
which.max(summary(allregressions)$adjr2)
```
### Mallowâ€™s Cp ?
```{r}
which.min(summary(allregressions)$cp)
```
### BIC ?
```{r}
which.min(summary(allregressions)$bic)
```
Based on the above response of the *allregressions object* we can observe that 
Model 7 has the best adjusted R2 , Mallow's Cp and BIC. Therefore we can get
the corresponding coefficients and predictors of these models, and they all 
have shell_weight, sex, diameter, height, whole_weight, shucked_weight and 
viscera_weight.
Since Model 7 is the best model selected we can get the coefficient as follows:- 
```{r}
coef(allregressions, which.max(summary(allregressions)$adjr2))
```
We will then use the **Forward selection** , **Backward Selection** and 
the **Bidirectional selection** to find the best model according to AIC?
### Intercept only model
```{r}
regnull <- lm(rings~1, data=Data)
```
### Model with all predictors
```{r}
regfull <- lm(rings~., data=Data)
```
### Let us first carry out the  **Forward selection**.
```{r}
step(regnull, scope=list(lower=regnull, upper=regfull), direction="forward")
```
Therefore we can understand from the **Forward selection** all predictors are included 
except the **length predictor**. Indicating that the seven predictors listed below 
are significant predictors.
### Therefore the regression equation selected is as the following for y hat:- 
$$
\hat{y} = 3.87038 + 8.75078x_1 -19.80258x_2 + 10.56951 x_3 + 8.97751x_4 -0.76889x_5
-10.61279x_6 + 10.74911x_7
$$
### Let us now carry out the  **Backward selection**.
```{r}
step(regfull, scope=list(lower=regnull, upper=regfull), direction="backward")
```
Therefore we can understand from the **Backward selection** also includes all predictors 
except the **length predictor**. Indicating that the seven predictors listed below 
are significant predictors. T
### Therefore the regression equation selected is as the following for y hat:- 
$$
\hat{y} = 3.87038 + 8.75078x_1 -19.80258x_2 + 10.56951 x_3 + 8.97751x_4 -0.76889x_5
-10.61279x_6 + 10.74911x_7
$$
This doesn't help much as it is similar to the forward selection. 
Since in our proposal we have mentioned that the observed correlation among the 
rings has a moderate correlation with all variables other than
sex and shucked weight of the abalone. We would like to force out these values and perform the 
**Backward selection**.
```{r}
data_set_with_numeric_sex <-
    Data %>%
    mutate(sex = replace(sex, sex == 'M', 0)) %>%
    mutate(sex = replace(sex, sex == 'F', 1)) %>%
    mutate(sex = replace(sex, sex == 'I', 2))
data_set_with_numeric_sex$sex <- as.numeric(data_set_with_numeric_sex$sex)
correlation_matrix <- cor(data_set_with_numeric_sex)
correlation_matrix
```
### Model with all predictors except excluding the sex and shucked weight of the abalone.
```{r}
regfull_excluding_sex_shucked_weight <- lm(rings~ diameter+height+whole_weight+viscera_weight+shell_weight+length, data=Data)
```
### Perform the Backward elimination from the regfull
```{r}
step(regfull_excluding_sex_shucked_weight, scope=list(lower=regnull, upper=regfull_excluding_sex_shucked_weight), direction="backward")
```
After excluding the sex and shucked_weight we can observe that this change has rendered 
the **viscera weight** as insignificant predictor.
### Therefore our adjusted regression equation for y hat is :- 
$$
\hat{y} = 3.702 + 14.387x_1 + 13.085x_2 - 5.959x_3 + 26.202x_4 -5.308x_5
$$
 If We would like to force out the sex and shucked weight of the abalone 
 and perform the **Bidirectional selection**, we would have found the same result 
 as the one stated above.
 
 
But if we do perform the **Forward selection** we can see that the *viscera_weight*
weight is considered as a significant predictor , 
which was dropped by **Backward and Bidirectional selections.**
```{r}
step(regfull_excluding_sex_shucked_weight, scope=list(lower=regnull, upper=regfull_excluding_sex_shucked_weight), direction="forward")
```
### Therefore our Forward selection regression equation for y hat is :- 
$$
\hat{y} = 3.674 + 14.318x_1 + 13.176x_2 - 5.671x_3 -1.203x_4 + 26.017x_5 -5.183x_6  
$$
 
 
**Forward selection**:- 
$$
x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ,x_4 ,x_5 , x_6  
$$
**Backward elimination** and **Bidirectional regression** 
$$
x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ,x_4 ,x_5
$$
"***Berk [1978]*** has noted that **forward selection**
tends to agree with all possible regressions for **small subset sizes** but not for large
ones, while **backward elimination** tends to agree with all possible regressions for
large subset sizes but not for small ones." 
Based on this our final regression equation and the model selection based on the AIC is 
excluding the  **viscera weight** (which is of a blacklip abalone is the gut weight after bleeding.)
When thinking logically about it , it seems like it does not have any relation
with the age of an abalone at all.
$$
\hat{y} = 3.702 + 14.387x_1 + 13.085x_2 - 5.959x_3 + 26.202x_4 -5.308x_5
$$


## We will now perform Non-linear transformation on the variables to improve the regression results.  

Let us perform the residual plot and see which of linear regressions model assumptions 
are met and/or if we do need improvement transformation.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results="show", message=FALSE, fig.width = 5.3, fig.height = 3.8, fig.align='center'}
linear_model <- lm(rings ~ length + diameter + height + shell_weight , data = Data)
ggplot(
    data.frame(
        the_residuals = linear_model$residuals,
        predicted_rings = linear_model$fitted.values
    ),
    aes(x = predicted_rings, y = the_residuals)
) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
    labs(
        x = "predicted number of rings",
        y = "externally studentized residual",
        title = "Residuals vs. Predicted Number of Rings\nfor Length, Diameter, Height, and Shell Weight"
    ) +
theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 11),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0)
)
```

 
 
 
# Let us first attempt the Box Cox Transformation on the response variable y (rings).

$$
The \ Transformation \ takes\ the\ form\: y^* = y^\lambda
$$

$$
if\: \lambda = 0 , \:we \: perform \: a \: log \:transformation 
$$



```{r}
boxcox(linear_model)
```

 The result suggest that we have 0 within range and that we can perform a log 
 transformation to linearize the non-random right funnel like distribution. 
 
 For a better observation to see that the lambda lies between the 3 dotted vertical lines,
 we will zoom in on the plot.
 
```{r}
boxcox(linear_model, lambda = seq(-0.5,0.5,1/10))
```
 
 Therefore let us now perform the log transformation on the Dataset.
```{r} 
data_to_transform <-  Data[, c(2,3,4,8)]
head(data_to_transform)
```
## Since based on the properities of logrithm we can not take the logarithm of a 
negative number or of zero we will add the constant value of 1 to all the values 
of length , diameter , height and shell weight.

```{r}
data_to_transform <-  data_to_transform + 1
head(data_to_transform)
```

## We can now perform the Log transform 

```{r}
xstar <- log(data_to_transform)
```

## Append the transformed data to the main Dataset 
```{r}
Data<-data.frame(Data,xstar)
```

## Regress the response variable of rings on the transformed regressors

```{r}
head(Data)
Data.xstar<-lm(rings~length.1+diameter.1+height.1+shell_weight.1, data=Data)
```


## Extract the y hat and the residuals
```{r}
yhat2<-Data.xstar$fitted.values
res2<-Data.xstar$residuals
```


## Add the y hat and the residuals to the data frame
```{r}
Data<-data.frame(Data,yhat2,res2)
```


## Residual plot with xstar

```{r}
ggplot(Data, aes(x=yhat2,y=res2))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color="red")+
  labs(x="Fitted y", y="Residuals", title="Residual Plot with xstar")
```


## We can observe improvement on the Residuals more evenly scattered across horizontal line.
## The Vertical spread appears constant ; thus the assumptions 1 and 2 both met. 

## ACF Plot of residuals went over the blue dotted line; but this occured because
## we add 1 to all the data values previously.
```{r} 
acf(res2, main="ACF Plot of Residuals with xstar")
```
 

## QQ plot of residuals
```{r}
qqnorm(res2)
```


# Confidence Intervals

Create a 95-percent confidence family of confidence intervals for the difference
in the expected value of the mean number of rings for **male and infant**,
**female and infant**, and **female and male abalones**?

For a given $shell \ weight$, a male blacklip abalone has a number of rings that is a factor of $exp(\beta_2)$ larger than an infant abalone. A female blacklip abalone has a number of rings that is a factor of $exp(\beta_3)$ larger than an infant abalone. A female blacklip abalone has a number of rings that is a factor of $exp(\beta_3 - \beta_2)$ larger than a male abalone.

```{r}
head(Data)
```

```{r}
class(Data$rings)
```

```{r}
class(Data$sex)
```

```{r}
Data$sex <- factor(Data$sex)
```

```{r}
levels(Data$sex) 
```


```{r}
boxplot(sex=="M" ~ rings, data=Data)
```


```{r}
boxplot(sex=="F" ~ rings, data=Data)
```

 
 
```{r}
boxplot(sex=="I" ~ rings, data=Data)
```
 
 Let us decide if we would like to make the assumptions that the population
 variances are equal or non-equal from the Box plot above. We can observe a close
 similarity between male and female, But a there seems that their is a large variation in number of rings in Infant group.  
 
 Thus we need to compare the actual variance in each sex group.
 
```{r}
var(Data$rings[Data$sex=="M"])
```
 
```{r}
var(Data$rings[Data$sex=="F"])
```
 
```{r}
var(Data$rings[Data$sex=="I"])
```
 
 
 Although it is small we can observe the variance difference between the 
male and female group , and also the smaller Infant group. Thus we conclude that we have evidence to believe that the population variances are non-equal and we will 
use the non-equal assumption in our t-test.

**T-test for number of rings against the Male blacklip abalone.**

```{r}
t.test(Data$sex=="M", Data$rings,
       alternative ="two.sided",

```


**T-test for number of rings against the Female blacklip abalone.**

```
 
 The 95% Confidence Interval for the Model that includes:
 
$$
E(Y|x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1length + \beta_2diameter + \beta_3height + \beta_4shellweight
