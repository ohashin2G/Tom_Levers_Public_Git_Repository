7.  In the lab, we applied random forests to the Boston data using `mtry = 6` and using `ntree = 25` and `ntree = 500`. 

    Create a plot displaying the test error resulting from random forests on this data set for a more comprehensive range of values for mtry and ntree. You can model your plot after Figure 8.10. Describe the results obtained.

    ```{r}
    library(ISLR2)
    library(randomForest)
    library(TomLeversRPackage)

    Above is a plot of Test Mean Squared Error for random forests predicting median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars based on the other variables of data set `ISLR2::Boston`. Variable $mtry$ represents the number of variables considered at each split. Red, green, and blue curves correspond to random forests with $mtry$ equal to the number of predictors, half the number of predictors, and the square root of the number of predictors, respectively. For each curve, Test Mean Squared Error decreases exponentially with number of trees. A random forest with $mtry$ equal to the number of predictors and a number of trees less than $25$ has the lowest Test Mean Squared Error and performs best.

11. This question uses the `Caravan` data set.

    (a) Create a training set consisting of the first 1,000 observations, and a test set consisting of the remaining observations.
    
        ```{r}
        set.seed(1)
        Caravan$Purchase <- ifelse(Caravan$Purchase == "Yes", 1, 0)
        training_data <- Caravan[1:1000, ]
        testing_data <- Caravan[-c(1:1000), ]
        ```

    (b) Fit a boosting model to the training set with `Purchase` as the response and the other variables as predictors. Use 1,000 trees, and a shrinkage value of 0.01. Which predictors appear to be the most important?
    
        ```{r}
        the_gbm.object <- gbm::gbm(
            formula = Purchase ~ .,
            distribution = "adaboost",
            data = training_data,
            n.trees = 1000,
            shrinkage = 0.01
        )
        summary(the_gbm.object)
        ```
        
        According to [Understanding Gradient Boosting Machines](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-gradient-boosting-machines-9be756fe76ab), an "important feature in the gbm modelling is the Variable Importance. Applying the summary function to a gbm output produces both a Variable Importance Table and a Plot of the model. This table [above] ranks the individual variables based on their relative influence, which is a measure indicating the relative importance of each variable in training the model."
        
        $PPERSAUT$ and $MKOOPKLA$ appear to our most important predictors.

    (c) Use the boosting model to predict the response on the test data. Predict that a person will make a purchase if the estimated probability of purchase is greater than 20 %. Form a confusion matrix. What fraction of the people predicted to make a purchase do in fact make one? How does this compare with the results obtained from applying KNN or logistic regression to this data set?

        ```{r}
        vector_of_predicted_probabilities <- predict(
            object = the_gbm.object,
            testing_data,
            n.trees = 1000,
            type = "response"
        )
        vector_of_predictions <- ifelse(
            test = vector_of_predicted_probabilities > 0.2,
            yes = 1,
            no = 0
        )
        table(testing_data$Purchase, vector_of_predictions)
        ```
        
        The fraction of the people predicted to make a purchase that do in fact make one and the precision of our Generalized Boosting Model for an AdaBoost distribution and threshold of $0.2$ $PPV = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \frac{19}{19 + 63} = 0.232$.
        
        ```{r}
        logistic_regression_model <- glm(
            formula = Purchase ~ .,
            data = training_data,
            family = "binomial"
        )
        vector_of_predicted_probabilities <- predict(
            object = logistic_regression_model,
            testing_data,
            type = "response"
        )
        vector_of_predictions <- ifelse(
            test = vector_of_predicted_probabilities > 0.2,
            yes = 1,
            no = 0
        )
        table(testing_data$Purchase, vector_of_predictions)
        ```
        
        The precision of a logistic regression model with threshold $0.2$ is $PPV = \frac{58}{58 + 350} = 0.142$. The rate of difference in precision between our Generalized Boosting Model and our logistic regression model is $\frac{0.232 - 0.142}{0.142} = 0.634$.
