    "## Problem 1\n",
    "The Genius API documentation is here: https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1. Read through the documentation carefully. Although the Genius API is free and public, it still requires users to use an access key to use the API. In this case, Genius provides users with three codes: a client ID, a client ID secret, and a client access token. Use the documentation to find a way to obtain these codes for yourself. Write a paragraph that describes all of the steps you needed to take (but DO NOT list your access codes in this paragraph).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hints and cautions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before you can use the API, you will need a regular, free user account with Genius. Sign-up here: https://genius.com/signup_or_login\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Genius's API is built to support third-party app development, not data scientists. The language is entirely geared toward app development. Under \"Authentication\" there are instructions to third-party developers for guiding their own users in getting access keys. That's not relevant to getting access for yourself. It's not hard to get an access key, but the guidance here is not very clear. Be patient and read everything in the Authentication section carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you arrive at the page that allows you to register for API access keys, the language is still geared toward app development. You will be prompted to name your app and provide the URLs associated with the app. It doesn't much matter what you name your app, and I just used the Collab main page (https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal?containerLogin=true) for the URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When you get your codes, copy them in a text file. In problem 2 you will copy these codes over again to a `.env` file. [4 points]"

       "'Tangled Up in Blue Lyrics[Verse 1]\\nEarly one morning the sun was shining\\nI was laying in bed\\nWondering if she\\'d changed at all\\nIf her hair was still red\\nHer folks they said our lives together\\nSure was going to be rough\\nThey never did like Mama\\'s homemade dress\\nPapa\\'s bankbook wasn\\'t big enough\\nAnd I was standing on the side of the road\\nRain falling on my shoes\\nHeading out for the East Coast\\nLord knows I\\'ve paid some dues\\nGetting through\\nTangled up in blue\\n[Verse 2]\\nShe was married when we first met\\nSoon to be divorced\\nI helped her out of a jam, I guess\\nBut I used a little too much force\\nWe drove that car as far as we could\\nAbandoned it out west\\nSplit up on a dark sad night\\nBoth agreeing it was best\\nShe turned around to look at me\\nAs I was walking away\\nI heard her say over my shoulder\\n\"We\\'ll meet again someday\\nOn the avenue\"\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\nI had a job in the great north woods\\nWorking as a cook for a spell\\nBut I never did like it all that much\\nAnd one day the ax just fell\\nSo I drifted down to New Orleans\\nWhere I lucky was to be employed\\nWorking for a while on a fishing boat\\nRight outside of Delacroix\\nBut all the while I was alone\\nThe past was close behind\\nI seen a lot of women\\nBut she never escaped my mind\\nAnd I just grew\\nTangled up in blue\\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\\nShe was working in a topless place\\nAnd I stopped in for a beer\\nI just kept looking at the side of her face\\nIn the spotlight, so clear\\nAnd later on, when the crowd thinned out\\nI was just about to do the same\\nShe was standing there, in back of my chair\\nSaid, \"Tell me, don\\'t I know your name?\"\\nI muttered something underneath my breath\\nShe studied the lines on my face\\nI must admit, I felt a little uneasy\\nWhen she bent down to tie the laces\\nOf my shoe\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n[Verse 5]\\nShe lit a burner on the stove\\nAnd offered me a pipe\\n\"I thought you\\'d never say hello,\" she said\\n\"You look like the silent type\"\\nThen she opened up a book of poems\\nAnd handed it to me\\nWritten by an Italian poet\\nFrom the thirteenth century\\nAnd every one of them words rang true\\nAnd glowed like burning coal\\nPouring off of every page\\nLike it was written in my soul\\nFrom me to you\\nTangled up in blue\\n[Verse 6]\\nI lived with them on Montague Street\\nIn a basement down the stairs\\nThere was music in the cafes at night\\nAnd revolution in the air\\nThen he started into dealing with slaves\\nAnd something inside of him died\\nShe had to sell everything she owned\\nAnd froze up inside\\nAnd when it finally, the bottom fell out\\nI became withdrawn\\nThe only thing I knew how to do\\nWas to keep on keeping on\\nLike a bird that flew\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n[Verse 7]\\nSo now I\\'m going back again\\nI got to get to her somehow\\nAll the people we used to know\\nThey\\'re an illusion to me now\\nSome are mathematicians\\nSome are carpenter\\'s wives\\nDon\\'t know how it all got started\\nI don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with their lives\\nBut me, I\\'m still on the road\\nA-heading for another joint\\nWe always did feel the same\\nWe just saw it from a different point\\nOf view\\nTangled up in blue24Embed'"
